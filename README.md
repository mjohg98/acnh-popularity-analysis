## Animal Crossing New Horizons: Popularity Analysis

This repository contains code for the analysis of the popularity of villagers from the video game Animal Crossing New Horizons. Motivation for this analysis was to understand if villager popularity was tied to certain charactersitics such as species, gender, personality or hobby. 

Villager popularity is derived from monthly poll data complied at: https://www.animalcrossingportal.com/tier-lists/new-horizons/all-villagers and in this analysis poll data is taken over August 2020 to July 2022.  

Analysis was carried out entirely using standard Python libraries for data analysis including NumPy, Pandas, SciPy and matplotlib for the visualisations. The Python file "test" contains functions used to compute key statistics and create visuals. Code, methodology and analysis is written in the Jupyter notebook named "acnh_workbook".
